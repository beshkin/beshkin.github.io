## Github deploy
Found it quite difficult to deploy current project to github to run there. 

### GH pages
Deployment of GH pages was pretty easy and another branch was created for that purposes.
But it works only for React-based web-app.

### NestJS and DB
Have no idea how to deal with NestJS and database in github pages. Looked through many forums, documentation and still not working.
